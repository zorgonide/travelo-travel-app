The application has 3 types of users with the following functionality - 

Customers - 
 - **Rent** a vehicle at any location in the city, as long as there is a working vehicle available at that location.
 -    **Return** a vehicle to any location. When a customer returns a vehicle, their account is **charged** an amount depending on how long the vehicle rental was and what type of vehicle was used.
 - **Report a vehicle** as defective.
 - **Pay** any charges on their account.

Operators -
 - **Track** the location of all vehicles in the city.
 - **Charge** a vehicle when the battery is depleted.
 - **Repair** a defective vehicle.
 - **Move vehicles** to different locations around the city as needed.

Managers -
 - **Generate reports** showing all vehicle activities over a defined time period, using appropriate **data visualisation** techniques.
